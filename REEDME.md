## Class :

- Class is a blueprint/Structure of actual Object
- Uses class can avoid duplicacy code, write bug free clean code, easy to maintain.
- Class have a build-in function called constructor, that call autometically when call create new instance.
- Class properties are initiate by Class contructor.
- Class have custom function that call method.

## Four pillars of Classes

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstruction
- Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

- Properties and Methods are organized into the class.
- Easy to read and maintain.
- properies and methods are can be controlable using private, protected, public.

## Inheritance

- Child class inherites parent class public properties and methods.
- Private properties and method are not accessable in outsite of its own class but set private properties value from child to parent class through super() function
